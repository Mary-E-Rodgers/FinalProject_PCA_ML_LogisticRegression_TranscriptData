# FinalProject_PCA_ML_LogisticRegression_TranscriptData
This was the final project for my data analytics course at Vanderbilt University with Dr. Scott Crossley. 
Morphological and summary level transcript data obtained from kaggle was analyzed in R Studio through the use of a principal component analysis that was then analyzed using a machine learning approach to logistic regression to see what predicted speech language impairment in a sample of 534 children.
